    "text": "You WILL get frustrated while learning R!\nFrom Garrett Grolemund’s Prologue of his book Hands-On Programming with R1:\n\nAs you learn to program, you are going to get frustrated. You are learning a new language, and it will take time to become fluent. But frustration is not just natural, it’s actually a positive sign that you should watch for. Frustration is your brain’s way of being lazy; it’s trying to get you to quit and go do something easy or fun. If you want to get physically fitter, you need to push your body even though it complains. If you want to get better at programming, you’ll need to push your brain. Recognize when you get frustrated and see it as a good thing: you’re now stretching yourself. Push yourself a little further every day, and you’ll soon be a confident programmer.\n\nGrolemund, Garrett. 2014. Hands-on Programming with R. O’Reilly. https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/"

You are learning a new language, and it will take time to become fluent. But frustration is not just natural, it’s actually a positive sign that you should watch for. Frustration is your brain’s way of being lazy; it’s trying to get you to quit and go do something easy or fun. If you want to get physically fitter, you need to push your body even though it complains. If you want to get better at programming, you’ll need to push your brain. Recognize when you get frustrated and see it as a good thing: you’re now stretching yourself. Push yourself a little further every day, and you’ll soon be a confident programmer."

Upload both your .qmd code file and the rendered .html file.\n\nUse the assignment .qmd file linked to above as a template for your own assignment.\n\nFor each question, make sure to show all of your work. This includes all code and resulting output in the html file to support your answers for exercises requiring work done in R (including any arithmetic calculations).\nFor each question, include a sentence summarizing the answer for that question in the context of the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along!

    "text": "NBE 2: Tylenol during pregnancy?\nOn Monday, September 22, 2025, President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that taking acetaminophen (the active ingredient in the pain reliever Tylenol) during pregnancy was a cause autism in the child. This led to an extensive debate on the topic, much of which has focused on a systemic review of observational studies researching the association between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism spectrum disorder (Evaluation of the evidence on acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders using the Navigation Guide methodology). There are many news reports that discussed this issue, one of which is from the New York Times, “Debate Flares Over an Unproven Link Between Tylenol and Autism”\n\na) Causation?\nCan causation be deduced based on the observational studies in the systemic review linked to above? Explain why or why not.\n\n\nb) Experiment?\nWould it be ethical to conduct an experiment to study the effects of prenatal acetaminophen use on the development of autism spectrum disorder\n\n\nc) Sampling: stratified\nDescribe a stratified sampling method that could be used to study this topic in a hypothetical study.\n\n\nd) Sampling: cluster\nDescribe a cluster sampling method that could be used to study this topic in a hypothetical study.\n\n\ne) Sampling: Multistage sample\nDescribe a multistage sample sampling method that could be used to study this topic in a hypothetical study.\n\n\nf) Sampling method type?\nOne of the studies included in the systematic review included “All Singleton live born children in Sweden with linkable personal identifiers with follow-up until Dec 31,2021.” What type of sampling method did they use?"
